üìä Sales Analysis Project
üìù Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover insights into profitability, customer behavior, product performance, and regional trends. Using Microsoft Excel, I applied formulas, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and advanced functions to transform raw data into meaningful business insights.

The analysis helps businesses answer critical questions such as:

Which products and categories are driving the most profit?

Who are the top customers?

How do sales vary by region, segment, and shipping mode?

What are the key revenue drivers?

üîë Key Objectives & Insights
1. Understanding Sales Trends

Calculated total profit by category and sub-category.

Analyzed total sales per product.

Identified the city with the highest sales.

Determined the most common shipping mode used by customers.

Found the product with the highest sales per unit (total sales √∑ quantity).

Counted the total number of unique customers.

Created a pivot table of sales by customers and highlighted the Top 3 customers.

Built a pivot chart to visualize sales distribution by segment with slicers for Region and Ship Mode.

Measured the percentage of customers in each segment.

Calculated each category‚Äôs contribution to overall sales.

2. Regional Insights

Used the FILTER function to find regions for states and calculated state-level sales.

Identified states with sales > $10,000.

Created a pivot table to show sales by region and category.

Calculated average sales per order in each region.

Found the percentage of total sales contributed by each region using SUMIF.

3. Identifying Key Drivers of Revenue

Calculated total sales by order ID and applied conditional formatting to highlight orders above average.

Built a table for the Top 5 Order IDs, showing category-wise sales using INDEX-MATCH.

Segmented orders into defined sales ranges (<$100, $100‚Äì$200, ‚Ä¶, >$1,000) using COUNTIFS.
